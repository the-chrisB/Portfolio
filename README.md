**Summary**

I am  an innovative research scientist with more than a decade of experience in data collection, processing, analysis, and modeling within academia and for-profit companies.  I also have experience presenting complex statistical models in easily understood ways regardless of the experience of the audience.  Additionally, I have experience with purchasing, procurement, and budget monitoring while balancing administrative work with research.   Lastly, I routinely self-educate as needed to stay on track with the ever changing world of data science.

**Skills**

- Data gathering, cleaning, formatting, and filtering in with spreadsheets and Databases
- Data manipulation and filtering with PostgreSQL and Bigquery
- Execution of machine learning algorithms in R and Python
- Building and deploying reactive apps in  R Shiny                                                                                              
- Fund aquisition through federal and state grant writing and submission 
- Able to think critically and communicate with co-workers and collaborators to achieve goals in a timely manner

**Experience**

- *Upwork*, Remote — Freelance Data Scientist
  - August 2024 - Present
    - Boost client success with data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization in both R and Python.  
     With clear communication, insightful guidance, thorough analysis, and comprehensive reporting, I am able to provide clients with the data-driven insights regardless of 
     their area of expertise.
- *Energy Northwest*, Richland, WA — Grant Management, Data Analysis, and Visualization Specialist (temporary/contract position)
  - April 2024 - August 2024
   - Facilitated grant proposal awarding by editing and critiquing a  proposal to construct several EV fast charging stations east of the Cascade Mountains in Washington  
     State.  This project will greatly assist in achieving the state mandate that all vehicles purchased  or registered in the state must be EV by 2030.   
   - Forecasted project cost of the EV charging station grant in an easily communicable and understandable  way regardless of the professional focus of the audience through 
     visualizations using the matplotlib and seaborn Python modules. 
   - Investigated Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) through federal (Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy) and state (Washington State Department of 
     Commerce) entities and summarized technical aspects of the grants in easily communicable terms .
- *Washington State University*, Richland, WA — Research Associate in Applied Machine Learning
  - May 2016 - April 2024
   - Successfully designed and executed a project that utilized unsupervised machine learning to identify the Raman spectra of certain phenolic compounds using  Surface 
     Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) and supervised machine learning to quantify those compounds once identified.  This  pioneering work clearly demonstrates that SERS 
     combined with machine learning can be used to model  small organic molecules such as phenolics.  
   - Successfully designed and executed a project for tracking alcoholic fermentation of red and white  wines using spontaneous Raman spectroscopy (SRS) and quantitative 
     machine learning algorithms.  This methodology greatly simplifies and expedites accurate tracking of fermenting wines by exposing said wines to a non-destructive laser 
     beam and recording their subsequent Raman spectra.  
   - Successfully designed and executed a project focussed on quickly and accurately predicting the phenolic content of red wine by recording their UV-visible spectra.  This 
     work led to the development and deployment of  Shiny apps using the Posit’s Shiny framework in commercial wineries in Washington State and California.  With the apps, 
     anyone can accurately predict the concentration phenolic compounds in their wine regardless of their level of expertise.
   - Routinely mentored graduate students, edited graduate theses and manuscripts.
   - Handled purchasing and reconciliation.
   - Routinely analyzed and visualized data using the R and Python languages.
   - Created posters and other media to gain interest in awarded grants and attract certificate students and participate in workshops.
   - Wrote and edited manuscripts and submitted them for publication for my own work as well as other projects I was directly involved with.
- *Washington State University IAREC*, Prosser, WA — Research Associate in Data Modeling for Regression and Classification 
  - June 2011 - May 2016
   - Successfully designed and executed a project for predicting mean tannin polymer size in red wines by constructing a model using tannins that were first isolated from 
     raw cacao beans using flash chromatography and preparative High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).  By isolating polymers of specific sizes, this work allows for 
     more accurate prediction of tannin polymer size in red wines which is directly correlated with wine longevity and hence cost. 
   - Routinely analyzed and visualized data using the R language to fulfill various project requirements.
   - Wrote and published manuscripts of my work in accordance with journal format requirements.

- Currently in collaboration with  commercial wineries in California and Washington State who use one of my Shiny apps that is deployed over a cloud server for quantitative 
  prediction and monitoring of phenolic compounds in red wine
